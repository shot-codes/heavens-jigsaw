# Heavens Jigsaw

This is a small demo of how to integrate an existing vanilla threejs vite application with threlte. It shows how you can freely intermix vanilla threejs code with Threlte code. Further, it extends some of the the optimizations built-in to the threlte renderer to your vanilla three code.

You can get it up and running with the following:
```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

Of interested to you will be whats happening in `main.js` and `svelteStuff/VanillaThreeIntegration.svelte`. I've tried to leave some helpful comments and it's pretty minimal so it should be easy to understand.
